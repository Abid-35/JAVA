## ❗ Why "Java is not 100% Object-Oriented"?

Java uses **primitive data types** like `int`, `float`, `boolean`, etc., which are **not objects**.  
This is why **Java is ~99% object-oriented**, not 100%.  
But it still offers full **OOP support** through classes, objects, and concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.
